**TH3D Unified Firmware with changes for my custom machines**

----------

This firmware is NOT maintained by TH3D. This is meant to be a personal fork/branch that will never be merged back to TH3D Unified Firmware.

It uses a separate configuration file which provides me the ability to make my own custom changes while merging in upstream TH3D firmware updates that support future TH3D products.

Based on [Marlin](http://marlinfw.org) 1.1.9 Stable. Highly customized and modified for easy use with stock printer boards. If you have a custom machine it is best to use vanilla [Marlin](http://marlinfw.org).
